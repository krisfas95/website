            <h3>Kristina Fasulo</h3>

        <br></br>
        <p>My name is Kristina Fasulo and I am an aspriring student with dreams of working in the marketing communications, advertisting, graphic design, and/or social media fields. I was born January 13, 1995 in Staten Island, New York. I am currently 20 years old and attending The College of New Jersey for Marketing with a minor in Interactive Multimedia.</p>
            <p>I grew up in the small town of Stewartsville, New Jersey and would always dream to be a Rockette. I have been dancing for 17 years since I was three years old. Besides dancing, my parents noticed at an early age that I was very talented with computers. It helped that my father is in IT, but they noticed I would be able to solve most problems and excelled in the courses during my early years. I decided to keep up on my technological skills with taking more advance courses throughout my high school career. Throughout those four years, I have acquired many skills such as the basics of Adobe Photoshop, Fireworks, InDesign, Premiere, and other similar software. I also continues to expand my horizons by taking many art courses including painting, while getting involved with the television station and founding and starting a club, "Video Yearbook Club" </p>
            <p>After falling in love with The College of New Jersey's campus, I decided to accept and go in as an undecided, open-options Business student. With nothing in mind besides dance, I had no idea what I wanted to do. After my first semester at The College of New Jersey, I realized how much I missed my graphic design courses and decided to take interactive multimedia class and fell in love. I picked up a minor before I declared a major. Later after much analysis, I decided to declare in marketing as well as give up my dreams of dancing for a career path. </p>
                <p>After two years of rigurous dance team experience, when I realized I no longer wanted to choose that life for myself, I quit the dance team in aspiration of other involvement. I quickly got involved with the tv station on campus, Lions Television and the peer mentor group for the School of Business. Later, I found a job at the bookstore, accepted to be an Ambassador, which only 35 out of about 400 applicants get accepted, and rushed for the new sorority and became a founding sister of Alpha Xi Delta. </p>
          <p>Besides all the leadership and activities on campus, I love to craft, hangout with friends, and help others with various projects when I can. This includes planning my sorority's Fall Date Party, editing packages for LionsTelevision, watching New York Ranger games with my dad, and binge watching One Tree Hill on Netflix.</p>
         <p>After much analysis and personality-trait quizzes, I decided on a major and a minor, which blend quite eloquiently. This makes me beyond passionate and excited for what I want to do with my life.   My anticipated graduation date is Spring of 2017. I hope to further my skillset, achieve more internship experience, to further my workforce experience.</p>
